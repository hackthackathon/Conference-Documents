**Hack the Hackathon is a welcome and open space for hackathon organizers, researchers, and people looking to join the community. Hack the Hackathon promotes a policy of respect and understanding. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at Hack the Hackathon, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a participant, volunteer, organizer, or other related position at an event makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.**

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
All participants in the event, inclusive of caterers, speakers, or other brief visitors, are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised lothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Hack the Hackathon organizers may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact HtH using the reporting procedures defined below.
Organizers will contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
We expect participants to follow these rules at all HtH venues, online interactions in relation to the event, HtH-related social events, and on HtH supplied transportation.
